# Checkpoint 1 submission is in "checkpoint1" folder
# Assignment 2 submission is in the form of perception_ws, a ros2 workspace

# Add the lidar's point cloud data rosbag, which publishes data over the topic "/carmaker/pointcloud" (if not, change the topic in perception_ws/src/assignment2/assignment2/pointcloud_classifier.py) in perception_ws/src/assignment2/rosbag_cones and rename it to cones.db3(see the perception_ws/src/assignment2/launch/launch_simulation.launch.py file).
